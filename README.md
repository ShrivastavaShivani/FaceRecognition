# FaceRecognition
Face Recognition using Eigen Faces, LBP and LDA
This Project is a part of Visual Recognition Course.
## Objective
The main purpose of this project is to see how PCA, LDA and LBP performs in Face Recognition.
## Face Recognition
Face Recognition is different from face detection. In face recognition, we deal with the identity of the faces unlike face detection where our main aim remains at making a bounding box around the face. In this project we will use eigen faces techique for face recognition.
## Why not Neural Networks
Using fancy things do not solve problem everytime. For getting started with a project requirement analysis is a must do thing. Our requirement for this project is dataset. The dataset that we have collected from Univeristy Students isn't large enough to train neural networks. Also, if we go about training neural networks, we might face dimensional issues. With higher dimensions neural networks might cost much higher time to train. So lets start with dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction techniques can be supervised as well as unsupervised. We will compare both techniques.
## PCA - Principal Component Analysis
